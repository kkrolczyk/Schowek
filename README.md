Schowek
=======

simple android PIM.



Todo: add availability to connect application through socket and write/read DB

Todo: Fix readme is a mess


BUGS:

- notes: fix user readable strings (also scrolling or better description)

- bilans: adding past date item is buggy

- main activity: security is non existent

- main activity: fix changing language when app is already loaded

- other: PL: add string "reset password to none"

- todo activity: a lot. tags, sorting, filter etc.


Todo: indicator how much notes are stored for now? allow to sort notes differently than creation time (for example by modification time, or size?), after tags - allow also to search in content, and allow searching via tags. Allow searching via full text.

Todo: test and improve bilans, and prepare at least stub of 5th submodule, shopping list creator (with checkboxes) allowing easy checking standard items to be bought, and perhaps in future integrate it with bilans (predicions, and moving shopping list instantly to bought summary - bilans)

Todo: bilans borrowed/lend should have add (with amount and date), and plain checkbox items to check returned date. 

Todo: birthday / calendar with anniversaries. in very distant future, if ever, if schowek evolves to contain sms archive and contact's db's = map/connect contact to some date. Or item to date. Or item to tag..etc,etc.



# Table of contents




# DONE

1. List of android studio required files to be able to import project between various devices
*.gradle files (also app/build.gradle, quite important). Besides obvious app directory. I had a list also what was responsible for what, and i'll update this readme with it.
